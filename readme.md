## Five significant feautures of react
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to improve performance by minimizing the number of updates needed to the actual DOM.

Components: React applications are built as a tree of reusable components that can be nested within each other to build complex UIs.

One-way data flow: React utilizes a unidirectional data flow, which simplifies data management and ensures consistency throughout the application.

JSX: React uses a syntax extension called JSX that allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage components.

React Native: React can also be used to build mobile applications using React Native, which allows developers to use the same codebase for both web and mobile apps.

## Five major advantages of React
Reusability: React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability, which can save time and effort in development.

Performance: The use of a virtual DOM and efficient updates can result in faster rendering and improved performance compared to traditional web frameworks.

Easy to learn: React's declarative syntax and modular design make it easier to learn and understand compared to other web frameworks.

Large community: React has a large and active community, which provides support, resources, and third-party libraries and tools to help developers.

Testability: React's architecture makes it easier to write automated tests, which can help ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## Notable differences between HTML and JSX
Syntax: HTML uses tags to define elements, while JSX uses a syntax that combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript expressions.
Attributes: In HTML, attributes are defined using quotes, while in JSX, attributes are defined using curly braces.
Components: In HTML, components are defined using custom elements, while in JSX, components are defined using functions or classes that return JSX.

Browsers can't read JSX directly because it is not valid JavaScript. JSX needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using a tool like Babel before it can be executed in the browser.
